latest: "The total number of confirmed, probable, and suspected cases in the West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported up to the end of 5 October 2014 is 8033 with 3865 deaths. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and the United States of America."

The total number of confirmed, probable, and suspected cases (see Annex 1) in the West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported up to the end of 5 October 2014 (epidemiological week 40) is 8033 with 3879 deaths. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and the United States of America. A confirmed case of EVD has been reported in Spain , but because the case was confirmed during the week ending 12 October (epidemiological week 41), information on this case will be included in the next Ebola Response Roadmap update. 

The past week has seen a continuation of recent trends: the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone continues to deteriorate, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD. Problems with data gathering in Liberia continue. It should be emphasized that the reported fall in the number of new cases in Liberia over the past three weeks is unlikely to be genuine. Rather, it reflects a deterioration in the ability of overwhelmed responders to record accurate epidemiological data. It is clear from field reports and first responders that EVD cases are being under-reported from several key locations, and laboratory data that have not yet been integrated into official estimates indicate an increase in the number of new cases in Liberia. There is no evidence that the EVD epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control, though there is evidence of a decline in incidence in the districts of Lofa in Liberia, and Kailahun and Kenema in Sierra Leone. 

#### Outline
This is the seventh in a series of regular situation reports on the Ebola Response Roadmap . The report contains a review of the epidemiological situation based on official information reported by ministries of health, and an assessment of the response measured against the core Roadmap indicators where available. The data contained in this report are the best available. Substantial efforts are ongoing to improve the availability and accuracy of information about both the epidemiological situation and the implementation of response measures. 

Following the roadmap structure, country reports fall into three categories: (1) those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); (2) those with an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Nigeria, Senegal, and the United States of America); and (3), those countries that neighbour areas of active transmission (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Senegal). An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there is a separate, unrelated outbreak of EVD, is also provided (see Annex 2). 

##### 1. COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION

The upward epidemic trend continues in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (table 1). 

##### GUINEA
Transmission in Guinea is persistent (figure 1), with approximately 100 new confirmed cases of EVD reported in the past week. For many weeks the outbreak in Guinea has been driven by transmission in three areas: the capital Conakry, Macenta, and Gueckedou, the region in which the outbreak originated. Although the number of reported new confirmed and probable cases in Gueckedou has been stable and low over the past four weeks, with between four and six cases reported each week, the number of new cases reported from Macenta varied between 15 and 71 cases reported each week over the same period. Transmission remains high in Conakry, with 15 new confirmed and probable cases reported in epidemiological week 40. The district of N’Zerekore has also reported a marked increase in the number of new cases reported, with 20 reported in epidemiological week 40. In the east of country, on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, the district of Lola has now reported cases of EVD for the first time (three confirmed cases; figure 4). The neighboring district of Beyla reported its first confirmed cases the previous week.

Table 1: Probable, confirmed, and suspected cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone

TABLE

*In Liberia, 77 more confirmed deaths have been reported than have confirmed cases. †In Sierra Leone, 86 more probable deaths have been reported than have probable cases. 275 of the additional deaths reported this week from Sierra Leone are the result of a retrospective analysis of hospital records. Data are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health up to the end of 5 October for Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 4 October for Liberia. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.*

##### LIBERIA
There continue to be profound problems affecting data acquisition in Liberia. Evidence obtained from responders and laboratory staff in the country indicates beyond doubt that there is widespread under-reporting of new cases, and that the situation in Liberia, and in Monrovia in particular, continues to deteriorate from week to week. Approximately 200 new probable and suspected cases, but very few confirmed cases, have been reported in the capital Monrovia in each of the past three weeks. A substantial proportion of these suspected cases are most probably genuine cases of EVD, and the reported fall in confirmed cases over the past three weeks reflects delays in matching laboratory results with clinical surveillance data. Efforts continue to urgently address problems with data acquisition in what is an extremely challenging environment, and it is likely that the figures will be revised upwards in due course. The district of Margibi continues to report high numbers of new confirmed and probable cases (31 in the past week), while the district of Grand Cape Mount has reported new cases for the first time in three weeks. There continues to be a fall in the number of new cases reported in Lofa, which borders Gueckedou in Guinea, with 12 confirmed and probable cases reported this week compared with 39 the previous week. This appears to be a genuine reduction.

##### SIERRA LEONE
Nationally, the situation in Sierra Leone continues to deteriorate, with an increase in the number of new confirmed cases reported over each of the past seven weeks (figure 3). The capital, Freetown, and the neighbouring districts of Bombali, Port Loko, and Moyamba, have all reported a surge in cases over the past seven to eight weeks. The districts of Bo and Tonkolili have also reported an increase in the number of new confirmed and probable cases over the same period. By contrast, a low number of new cases have been reported from Kailahun (three cases in epidemiological week 40) and Kenema (five cases in epidemiological week 40) for the past four weeks. These areas had previously reported high levels of transmission. Reports from responders suggest this fall is a genuine decline in incidence, although further investigation will be required before this can be confirmed. 

##### HEALTH-CARE WORKERS
The high number of EVD infections in health-care workers (HCWs) continues to be a cause of great concern. 401 HCWs are known to have been infected with EVD up to the end of 5 October. 232 HCWs have died (table 2).

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AND NEWLY AFECTED DISTRICTS
Figure 4 shows the location of cases throughout the countries with widespread and intense transmission. Eight districts in which previous cases were confirmed have reported no cases during the 21 days prior to the end of 5 October (seven districts in Guinea, one in Sierra Leone). In Guinea, the district of Lola has now reported cases of EVD for the first time (three confirmed cases).

RESPONSE IN COUNTRIES WITH WIDESPREAD AND INTENSE TRANSMISSION
In accordance with the aim of achieving full geographic coverage with complementary Ebola response activities in countries with widespread and intense transmission, WHO is monitoring response efforts in five domains (figure 5). The most recent developments in each domain are detailed below.
 
Case management: Ebola treatment centres, referral, and infection prevention and control 
In Liberia, a new EVD isolation centre was established in Maryland district. However, the number of beds currently available in Liberia and Sierra Leone still falls well short of the capacity required  (table 3).

A multidisciplinary team of 165 Cuban HCWs has now arrived in Sierra Leone. WHO is providing logistical support and training to the team to ensure they are deployed to areas that have been hardest hit by the outbreak.

Case confirmation
Eleven laboratories (two in Guinea, five in Liberia, and four in Sierra Leone) are now operating at full capacity. However, laboratory data are yet to be fully integrated with clinical surveillance systems. 

Surveillance
In Guinea, all districts apart from Dalaba and Lola report that more than 90% of registered contacts were seen each day during epidemiological week 40. In Liberia, only Montserrado district, which includes the capital Monrovia, has reported that 90% of registered contacts were seen on a daily basis. In Sierra Leone, seven of 14 districts reported that 90% of registered contacts were seen on a daily basis. However, many contacts in many areas are not registered with or known to the relevant authorities.

Safe and dignified burials
In Liberia, a newly established Ebola Task Force is now able to dispatch trained dead-body-management teams to ETCs and into communities to conduct safe burials. The Liberian Red Cross has trained additional dead-body-management teams in Montserrado district, which includes the capital Monrovia. The non-governmental organization Global Communities will fund the teams. In Sierra Leone, mechanisms for safe burial are now in place in all 14 districts.

Social mobilization 
In Guinea, as part of the Tabaski Festival, religious leaders were mobilized to deliver Ebola-prevention messages in 7000 sermons across the country. This effort was supplemented by an SMS-based campaign on hygiene practices. UNICEF is supporting a new national organization for survivors of EVD to facilitate their social reintegration, and help reduce the stigma associated with EVD.
In Liberia, community engagement and empowerment of civil society continues. However, denial of the existence of EVD remains a challenge.

In Sierra Leone, a National Communication Strategy on Ebola was presented to the Ministry of Health for approval. If approved, social mobilization activities linked to the strategy will be monitored in all districts.

*A full key to the color-coding of each indicator is contained in Annex 3. The data presented here are gathered from various secondary sources, including Ministries of Health and WHO reports, OCHA, UNICEF in Conakry and Geneva, and situation reports from non-governmental organizations. Information obtained during one-to-one communications with partners and representatives of medical teams is also included.*

2. COUNTRIES WITH AN INITIAL CASE OR CASES, OR WITH LOCALIZED TRANSMISSION
Three countries, Nigeria, Senegal, and the United States of America have now reported a case or cases imported from a country with widespread and intense transmission. 

In Nigeria, there have been 20 cases and eight deaths. In Senegal, there has been one case, but as yet there have been no deaths or further suspected cases attributable to Ebola (table 4). On 30 September 2014, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) was informed of the first confirmed imported case of EVD in the United States of America. The patient is an adult with recent travel history to West Africa who developed symptoms compatible with EVD on 24 September 2014, approximately 4 days after arriving in the United States of America. The patient sought medical care on 26 September 2014, and was admitted into isolation on 28 September 2014 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Samples were sent for testing to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, and to the Texas state laboratory. Results were positive for Ebola virus. 

In Nigeria, all 891 contacts have now completed 21-day follow-up (362 contacts in Lagos, 529 contacts in Port Harcourt). A second EVD-negative sample was obtained from the last confirmed case on 8 September (27 days ago). In Senegal, all contacts have now completed 21-day follow-up, with no further cases of EVD reported. A second EVD-negative sample was obtained from the single confirmed case in Senegal on 5 September (30 days ago). In the United States of America, 48 contacts are being followed up.

3. PREPAREDNESS OF COUNTRIES TO RAPIDLY DETECT AND RESPOND TO AN EBOLA EXPOSURE
The second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the IHR 2005 regarding the 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa was conducted with members and advisors of the Emergency Committee through electronic correspondence from 16 September 2014 through 21 September 2014. The Committee emphasized that all unaffected States with land borders adjoining States with EVD transmission should urgently establish surveillance for clusters of unexplained fever or deaths due to febrile illness; establish access to a qualified diagnostic laboratory for EVD; ensure that health workers are aware of and trained in appropriate IPC procedures; and establish rapid response teams with the capacity to investigate and manage EVD cases and their contacts. Assessment of preparedness in States neighboring States with EVD transmission is ongoing.

The Committee also recommends that all States should be prepared to detect, investigate, and manage Ebola cases; this should include assured access to a qualified diagnostic laboratory for EVD and, where appropriate, the capacity to manage travelers originating from known Ebola-infected areas who arrive at international airports or major land crossing points with unexplained febrile illness.
